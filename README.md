# Project for PHYS3051

This projects focuses on implementing the Klein Gordon equation on a quantum computer. 

Here we attempt to reproduce the results obtained from [M. Kapil et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00521), explain choices and methods used in their paper as well as offer criticisms and suggestions.

The code can be found in circuits.ipynb and the report in report/project_report.pdf.
